Doctors are now having to dish out larger sums of money in order to insure themselves adequately.

For instance, a doctor who would have had to pay Rs. 125 annually now has to pay up to Rs. 1500.  These costs will only be passed along to the patients in the long run, and the condition is only going to worsen.  Take for example the United States, where surgeons annually pay an average of $75,000 on insurance premiums.  On top of these premiums, doctors who practice very defensively add as much as $21 billion US to the health care bill every year.

Each piece of art is unique, a reflection of the artist's perceptions, insights and experiences.

Aristotle once said that \"Art is the human intelligence playing over the natural scene, ingeniously affecting it toward fulfillment of human purposes.\" (Bronowski 64)  This wonderful world of creation began in ancient times, when people first created images to express their response to the world around them.  Various civilizations in the past painted images preparing to understand life after death.  Another favorite subject was the glorification of gods and rulers.  The subject which an artist selects for a painting depends largely upon the time in which he/she lives.  A painter painting in the middle ages would probably have picked a religious subject, for that was almost the only kind of topic portrayed at the time.

The rocks are marine volcanogenic of felsic to intermediate composition and include copper- and zinc-bearing massive sulfides.

Mineralization occurred along a marine volcanic-derived hot spring along island-arc belts indicated by greenstones of ancient accreted marine terrains.  The deposits are distinguished by an upper stratified (black ore) zone, a lower stratiform (yellow ore) zone, and an underlying dispersed stockwork feeder zone.  The black ore is pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, and occasionally galena, barite, tetrahedrite, and bornite.  Yellow ore is composed of pyrite and chalcopyrite, with occasional sphalerite, pyrrhotite, and magnetite.  The stockwork veinlets are pyrite, chalcopyrite, gold, and silver.  Massive ore is found in a center of felsic volcanics near local fracturing associated with hot-springs, organic mudstones, pyritic siliceous shale, sulfide clasts, and breccia fragments.
