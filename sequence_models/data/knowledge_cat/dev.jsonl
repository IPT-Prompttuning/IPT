In this act, the hardest part to understand, was that the courts were to try to give a fair trial to any runaway slaves.

The convection current in the mantle drives plates around either against or away from each other.  These collisions give rise to earthquakes, volcanoes, mountains, and continental drift.  The crashing and spreading of the plates forms the landscape of the Earth as we see it today.  The positions of the land masses today is a result of continental drift.

Odoacer ruled for 13 years after gaining control.  He was then attacked and defeated by  Theodoric, the king of a Germanic tribe named the Ostrogoths.  Both kings, Theodoric and Odoacer ruled jointly until Theodoric murdered Odoacer.  Theodoric continued to rule Italy with a government comprised mostly of Italians and an army composed of Ostrogoths.  During his rule, he brought peace to the country but after his death in 526, the kingdom began to grow weak.  In 553, Justinian, the Byzantine emperor who ruled the eastern part of the Roman Empire, defeated the Ostrogoths and expelled them.  For a time, the Old Roman Empire was united again.

{"text": "Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \\~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\\n\\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\\n\\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.", "idx": 16101, "label": 9}

{"text": "Hirsch isn't looking to \"recreate the plots exactly.\"\\n\\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\\n\\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\\n\\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\\n\\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says.

If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\\n\\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\\n\\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a \"Red Queen's\" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\\n\\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya.

They can go through the Caribbean and up through the Gulf of Mexico towards New Orleans and Texas, our they can go toward the bottom of Florida in an almost parallel fashion or they can get caught up in the Gulf Stream and hook up the United States Eastern Seaboard. Most of the early season hurricanes follow the first path, while the late season hurricanes follow the other two paths predominantly(Miller,23).The problem is that if a late season does take the first path it could be just as harmful. The major factor about economical loss is the track taken. The first track goes through a part of the world that is not as rich as some of the other world. Also, when it hits the United States, the storms are going to hit some of the poorest states in the United States. Thus the real estate down there will not be as much. This is the exact opposite for the Atlantic coast of the United States. There are many areas that could get hit. Many resorts and heavily populated areas that would mean millions of dollars in damage. Hurricane Hugo caused 7 billion dollars in damage to the city of Charleston, SC alone( Reiter). This was a classic late season hurricane. Andrew was the only hurricane in my research that completely through off the late season theory, but it did take the right track. It hit the southern part of Florida that caused 20 million dollars in damage. The good part is that if it had moved 20 miles to the north it would have caused an estimated 70 billion dollars worth of damage in the Miami area( Reiter). Another point to this is this quote from Reiter, \" Applied Insurance Research estimates that in a worse-case scenario , based on the reality of past hurricanes, damage could reach $52 billion in New Orleans, $104 billion in New England and $106 in southeast Florida.\" What he is saying is that if the worst storm that had ever hit before came today, this would be the damage that would be caused.\n", "idx": 13246, "label": 8}

Tectonic forces deform the rocks on both sides of the fault.  At this point, rocks are bending and storing potential energy.  Finally, when the force exceeds the frictional force between the two rocks, the plates suddenly slip at the most vulnerable place.  The initial slip causes more slippage along the fault which in turn causes energy to be released.  The released energy produces vibrations called seismic waves which originate at the epicenter.  The San Andreas Fault is a well-known example of this released energy from a transform fault.  At this location, an almost straight valley is produced by the parallel fractures.

{"text": "\tRadioactive dating along with magnetic reversals provides a means to record the speed at which the ocean floor is spreading.  The youngest crust is where the magma flows out from the ridges and the oldest being where the crust flows back in the trenches.  Figure 66 shows the age of the oceanic crust.  Deep sea drilling and the art of radioactive dating could tell us when the magnetic field was reversed.  Ships equipped with hollow drills would obtain samples of the ocean floor from various places around the ridge.  The procedure most widely used to date the ocean floor is the Potassium-Argon dating method.  It relies on any present radioactive material, Potassium-40.  Potassium-40 decays slowly (1250 x 106 years) but not as slow as Uranium, which decays too slowly for this purpose and Carbon, which decays too fast.  Potassium-40 decays into Argon-40 and Calcium-40.  By measuring the amount of decay, the age of the ocean floor can be determined.  Knowing the time and distance, the velocity of the ocean floor spreading can then be determined.  It takes about 50 to 150 million years for the crust to travel from its origin to where it will circulate back below.  The crust is relatively new because it is always being renewed.\n", "idx": 12438, "label": 8}
